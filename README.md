# Lunar-Lander-Game

- A Java version of Lunar Lander game with a level editor.

- Terrains and landing pad can be reallocate in the edit panel by draging and double clicking (support undo and redo).

- Using keyboard WASD to guide the lunar lander to the landing pad without hitting the terrain or going out of bounds.

- Speed and fuel info as well as game messages are shown at the top left (Green indicates safe speed, red indicates low on fuel).

Some Features:

1. When the ship crashes (landing pad, terrains and world bounds), the world turns black
and the ship has a colourful explosion at the crashing position.
Explosion colour changes randomly when pressing any keys, resizing the window and motifing landingpad and terrains.

2. When the ship successfully landed on the landing pad, the world turns orange and fireworks rain from the top.
Colour of the firework can be changed randomly by any key or mouse events.
